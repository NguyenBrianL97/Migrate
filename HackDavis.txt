Overview:
"Carpool App" is a carpooling service for groups of any size (Varying from 15 to 200+~). Imagine you are a sports coach and almost everyday your 
athletes show up late because of slow, inefficient carpools (THis is the exact situation where the origin of "Carpool App")The app will take in the information
of all the athletes and make carpools that will save time and gas, resulting in an easier life routine and a cleaner, more breathable earth. You do not
need to be a coach of a team of 50 to use the app, you can be a handful of students simply getting to class, you can be a manager of a large company of 200 trying
to get employees on time and be more interactive with each other. Carpooling is a great thing to participate in and the "Carpool App" will make the process even easier.
